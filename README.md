# Echo
The SEO expert. Not affiliated with amazon Echo.

In the file echo_cleo, as of 7/19/2021, you must manually input the website addresses and name of the output files into two lists of equal size. Once you run the file it will find keywords, get the keywords hit via py.trends, and rank the keywords for each of the websites. The number of keywords it can get from each varies with a maximum of 20. 

The .bat file is something you target in task scheduler and it will run the echo_cleo on a set time to your choosing. For mine I set it to run every Tuesday at 8pm just for testing purposes. This website should be sufficient for running the windows task scheduler. https://datatofish.com/python-script-windows-scheduler/
